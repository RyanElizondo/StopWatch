# StopWatch
Stopwatch program that I made to learn how to the 'ActionEvent', 'ActionListener', and 'Jframe' features in java.
*HOW TO USE* Have both the 'main' and 'stopwatch' files open and run the 'main' file to call the stopwatch program and a window will open with a stopwatch with the option to start, stop or reset it.
